# Changelog

Notable changes to Mailchilla. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project
follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/lang/ru/).

The `mailchilla update` command reads the section belonging to a version out of
this file and shows it before asking for confirmation, so each entry should
read as something a person wants to know before updating.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-11

### Added

- `install.sh`: installation with one command, in English or Russian. It picks
  up the latest tag, generates `.env`, registers the systemd service and the
  `mailchilla` command.
- `mailchilla`: managing the installation — a menu when run on its own, and the
  same actions as subcommands (`status`, `restart`, `log`, `update`, `passwd`,
  `port`, `tunnel`, `check`, `backup`, `uninstall`).
- `mailchilla update`: updating to the latest tag with a backup of the
  configuration taken first and a rollback when the panel does not come up.
- A release workflow: a pushed `v*` tag is checked against `APP_VERSION` and
  published as a GitHub Release.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-09-11

The first version.
